Over the past six weeks of class, I feel I have done well in class. I've made it a priority to be punctual and focused during all class meetings. My attendance has been consistent, with no absences. I understand the importance of being present physically and mentally which can be a challenge of zoom. I have not participated much which is because I am generally a quiet person. In the second half of the semester I am going to strive to unmute and participate more. Outside of class I have gone through each of the textbook chapters at least once and tried a few practice problems to enhance my skills and make sure I understood the lesson. I have been able to commit weekly about nine hours outside of class.
Luckily, I haven't encountered many issues using codespaces. Your demonstration in class a few weeks ago about how to commit assignments resolved my confusion regarding how to turn in work.
I missed two assignments the past few weeks which is entirely my own fault for not following your advice and doing them immediately when avalible. I was on vacation in New Orleans and simply forgot about them. There is no excuse and I will make sure I don't miss any more for the rest of class.
